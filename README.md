## Quantum Signal Processing (QSP)


### Quantum line spectrum estimation algorithm for signal processing applications: The QISKIT Code is given here.

#### Line-spectrum estimation for singleton and multipleton frequencies are given in separate python files. Users need to create an IBM account for using the IBM quantum Hardware
